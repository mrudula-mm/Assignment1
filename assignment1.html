   <img src="images\cake.jpg"><br>
    <p>A <u><b>cake</b></u> is a sweet, baked, breadlike food, made with or without shortening, and usually containing <b>flour, sugar, baking powder or soda, 
        eggs, and liquid flavoring</b>. It can be as thin and flat as a plate or as fluffy as a cloud.The sweetened breads we all know and love as 
        cake can take on many flavors. Vanilla, fruit, and chocolate are all commonly added to the mix depending on oneâ€™s preferences. So long as
         it checks the basic ingredients and is a sweetened bread, cakes can be endlessly customizable.</p><br>
